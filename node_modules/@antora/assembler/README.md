# Antora Assembler

Antora Assembler provides a JavaScript library and a set of Antora extensions for merging content in an Antora site into assembly files and converting those files to another format, such as PDF.

The core of Assembler (this package) handles merging AsciiDoc content from multiple pages into an assembly.
It repeats this process for each selected component version.
It then delegates to a function or command (e.g., asciidoctor-pdf) designated by an exporter extension (a separate package) to convert the assembly files to an export format, such as PDF, resulting in an export.
Assembler then publishes the export files along with the other files in the site.

The exports can then be viewed offline, either by the browser or a reader application.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
The Assembler extends the feature set of Antora by providing the foundation for page aggregation.
